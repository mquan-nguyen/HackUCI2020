# HackUCI2020 Project - Specify for Spotify
*Built by Omar Yu, Matthew Nguyen, Derek Skinner, and Kevin Zheng*

This project was built during HackUCI 2020, from January 31 - February 2.

Specify for Spotify allows users to search in a much more precise way than normal, by allowing them to
select values for hidden attributes such as danceability, energy, instrumentalness, valence, and tempo. 
After selecting a specific genre, users will be generated a playlists consisting of 100 tracks that 
matches their desired attribute values and genre.
